## Fast-API

What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

It’s built on top of:

Starlette for the web parts (requests, responses, routing, etc.)

Pydantic for data validation and parsing

💡 Key Features
⚡ Fast
Extremely fast, comparable to NodeJS and Go thanks to ASGI and Starlette.

📜 Type Hints & Auto Validation
Uses Python type hints to automatically validate and serialize data using Pydantic.

🧪 Built-in Documentation
Automatically generates interactive API docs using:

Swagger UI: /docs

ReDoc: /redoc

🔐 Security
Easy handling of OAuth2, JWT, API keys, and more.

🛠️ Dependency Injection
Clean, powerful way to manage shared dependencies like DB sessions, auth tokens, etc.

📦 Async-Ready
Built with async/await — great for high-performance applications and I/O operations.

✅ Use Cases
RESTful APIs

Machine Learning model deployment

Microservices

Backend for mobile/web apps

IoT apps with lightweight API backends
